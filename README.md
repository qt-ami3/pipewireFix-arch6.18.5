not a serious fix, should not use as a permanent fix.

only works if restarting pipewire is a temp fix for ur system.

## WARNING 

this program is unoptimized and used system() to execute system command from the program, verify code yourelf before using.

## quirks:

resets volume when media stops playing, personally as someone who works with audio with all kinds of recording qaulity this is a feature but you probably will not enjoy it.

initial startup of apps takes longer.

volume randomly reverts to default level.
